                        Given a weighted, undirected graph G with n vertices and m edges.
                         You want to find a spanning tree of this graph which connects all vertices and has the least weight (i.e. the sum of weights of edges is minimal). 
                         A spanning tree is a set of edges such that any vertex can reach any other by exactly one simple path. 
                        The spanning tree with the least weight is called a minimum spanning tree.
